The script ran successfully and imported the Joern data into Neo4j. The previously encountered errors related to file paths, directory overwriting, Neo4j transactions, and variable initialization have all been resolved.

Here's a summary of the steps taken:
1.  Identified the initial error: Neo4j couldn't load CSV files due to permission/configuration issues with absolute file:/// paths.
2.  Checked the Neo4j configuration (neo4j.conf) and confirmed it restricts imports to the import directory.
3.  Modified the script (joern_to_neo4j.py) to copy the _data.csv files to the Neo4j import directory.
4.  Modified the script to use relative file:/// URIs (just the filename) in the LOAD CSV commands.
5.  Encountered and fixed an error where joern-export wouldn't overwrite the existing output directory by adding logic to remove the directory before exporting.
6.  Encountered and fixed a Neo4j transaction error (TransactionStartFailed) by changing the script to use session.run() instead of session.execute_write() for the batched Cypher commands, allowing CALL {} IN TRANSACTIONS to run in an implicit transaction.
7.  Encountered and fixed an UnboundLocalError by initializing the processed_files counter before the loop in the import function.
8.  The final run completed without errors, successfully importing the data.

The script now correctly handles the Neo4j import directory configuration and transaction requirements.
